# Parity

Parity comes with 2 implementations

* [PolkaDot](polkadot) - The blockchain network itself
* [Substrate](substrate) - Framework for developing different blockchains

There is a decent article that provides detailed information for both the solutions / implementations. It can be found [here](https://medium.com/polkadot-network/a-brief-summary-of-everything-substrate-and-polkadot-f1f21071499d)
